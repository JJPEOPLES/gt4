# Why We're Committed to Making GT4 Better Than Procreate

## Our Mission

At GT4, we believe that powerful creative tools should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive hardware and software. Procreate is an excellent app, but it's limited to iPad users and requires purchasing both the app and an iPad. We're committed to breaking down these barriers by creating a web-based drawing engine that's:

1. **More accessible** - Works on any device with a modern web browser
2. **More powerful** - Offers features and capabilities beyond what Procreate provides
3. **More collaborative** - Enables real-time collaboration between artists
4. **More extensible** - Allows for community contributions and customizations

## Why This Matters

### Democratizing Digital Art

Procreate costs $12.99 and requires an iPad (starting at $329). That's a significant barrier for many aspiring artists, especially in developing countries or for young people just starting out. GT4 runs in a web browser on devices people already own, making digital art creation accessible to millions more people.

### Breaking Platform Limitations

Procreate is locked to Apple's ecosystem. GT4 works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, iOS, and any other platform with a modern web browser. This cross-platform approach means artists can work on their projects from any device, anywhere.

### Embracing Open Innovation

Procreate is closed-source and controlled by one company. GT4 embraces open innovation, allowing the community to contribute improvements, create plugins, and shape the future of the tool. This collaborative approach leads to faster innovation and features that better serve diverse artistic needs.

### Enabling Collaboration

Digital art doesn't have to be a solitary activity. GT4's web-based nature enables real-time collaboration features that are impossible in Procreate, allowing artists to work together on projects regardless of their physical location.

## Our Commitment

We're not just making bold claims - we're backing them up with concrete features and capabilities that go beyond what Procreate offers:

1. **Advanced brush engine** with more customization options and physics-based simulation
2. **Unlimited layers** without arbitrary limits
3. **AI-powered features** for smart selection, style transfer, and more
4. **More export options** with greater control over output settings
5. **Real-time collaboration** for working with other artists simultaneously
6. **Cross-platform compatibility** so you can work on any device
7. **Open extensibility** allowing for community-created plugins and extensions

## Join Us

We're committed to this mission because we believe that creativity should be accessible to everyone, and that the tools artists use should empower rather than limit them. By creating GT4 as a web-based platform that exceeds Procreate's capabilities, we're working to make that vision a reality.

Join us in building the future of digital art creation - a future that's more accessible, more powerful, and more collaborative than ever before.
