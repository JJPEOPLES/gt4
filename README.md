# GT4 Drawing Engine

GT4 is a powerful web-based drawing engine designed for artists who want professional-grade tools without the high cost of software like Procreate. Built with React and modern web technologies, GT4 offers a comprehensive suite of drawing tools, effects, and AI-powered features that exceed what's available in many commercial applications.

## Setting Up the Creator Account

GT4 has a special "Prime" account that is reserved for the creator of the application. This account has special administrative privileges.

### Initial Setup

1. After deploying the application, navigate to `/init-creator` in your browser
2. Fill in the email and password you want to use for the Prime creator account
3. Click "Initialize Creator Account"
4. Once initialized, you'll be redirected to the creator login page

### Logging In as Creator

1. Navigate to `/creator-login` in your browser (or click the "Creator" link in the footer)
2. Enter the email and password you used during initialization
3. You'll be logged in as "Prime" with creator privileges

### Creator Privileges

## Live User Count
